# Go Byte Demonstration

A simple Go project demonstrating the fundamental concepts of bytes in Go, including byte manipulation, conversions between bytes and strings, and working with byte slices.

## Description

This project provides practical examples of working with bytes in Go, which are a fundamental building block in the language. Bytes in Go are essentially unsigned 8-bit integers (alias for `uint8`) that can hold values from 0 to 255, often used to represent ASCII characters.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or later

## Installation

TODO:

///////////

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bytedemo.git
   cd bytedemo
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   go build
   ```

## Usage

Run the program:

```bash
go run main.go
```

Or, after building:

```bash
./bytedemo
```

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Byte Basics

Bytes in Go are represented by the `byte` type (alias for `uint8`):

```go
var myByte byte = 65 // 65 is the ASCII value for 'A'
```

### 2. Byte to Character Conversion

Bytes can be displayed as their ASCII character representation:

```go
fmt.Printf("The character value of myByte is: %c\n", myByte) // Outputs: A
```

### 3. Byte Slices

A sequence of bytes is represented as a slice:

```go
byteSlice := []byte{72, 101, 108, 108, 111} // ASCII values for "Hello"
```

### 4. String and Byte Slice Conversions

Converting between strings and byte slices:

```go
// Byte slice to string
str := string(byteSlice)

// String to byte slice
myString := "World"
stringToBytes := []byte(myString)
```
